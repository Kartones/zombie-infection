    <p>Simulation Rules</p>

    <p>Zombies are green, move slowly and change direction randomly and frequently unless they can see something moving in front of them, in which case they start walking towards it. After a while they get bored and wander randomly again.</p>

    <p>If a zombie finds a survivor standing directly in front of it, it bites and infects them; the survivor immediately joins the ranks of the undead.</p>

    <p>Survivors are pink and run, occasionally changing direction at random. If they see a zombie directly in front of them, they turn around and panic.</p>

    <p>Panicked survivors are bright pink. If a survivor sees another panicked survivor, it starts panicking as well. A panicked survivor who has seen nothing to panic about for a while will calm down again.</p>


    <p>Controls</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Press Space, or click/tap inside the city to pause/unpause</strong></li>
    <li>Press s to alter the simulation speed</li>
    <li>Press r to uninfect all but one zombie (resets the city)</li>
    <li>Press + and - to adjust population (also resets the city)</li>
    <li>Press f to toggle complete panic</li>
    </ul>
